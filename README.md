Made by 3 people literally out of pure boredom, Aiming to rewrite Friday Night Funkin' in HaxeFlixel.
With (hopefully) easier modding with slightly more organized folder layouts, new features, etc.

# What we have planned
- Easy Modding (Working on it)
- Stages/Backgrounds (Yes we did characters before stages)
- Modcharts/Lua Scripting
- Custom Notes (Using LUA or smth, could have a json for storing shit like "act like death note or use lua file")
- Extra Keys (1k to 9k, Could change eventually)

# Finished
- Basic Gameplay (Characters, Health, Score/Accuracy/Misses, Notes)
- Menus (Title Screen is slightly unfinished)
