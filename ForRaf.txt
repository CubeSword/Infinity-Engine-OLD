Bro the reason why i made the Util shit is so my life can be a bit easier
like
default haxe shit be like:
fromSparrow['png path', 'xml path']

i mean i could do that with variables in the states but like cmon
i wanted it so you could just do

funnything.fromSparrow['file path, 'file name']

hell i could have even just did a path

and it could be like
funnything.fromSparrow['assets/imfuckingstupid/killme']

and it would find killme.png and killme.xml

the sound function being just "funny merge string shit"
well i was gonna remove it because i realized there's no point if you can just
type the path in

[except i myself can't because the game can't find shit in the assets folder]

but i won't add util shit so i don't accidentally piss you off
